Facebook Messenger Bot

This bot sends a message randomly from an array

I wanted to use it to spam myself with links to the Bell Let's Talk Day event since they donate 5 cents per share, but it turns out you actually have to click the share button on Facebook for it to work. So this project kind of just stopped.
